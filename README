README to undo.m

This package adds a poor mans version control and undo functionality to Mathematica.
For a previously saved notebook  'notebook.nb' a version info file 'notebook.nb.undo.mx' is created and every time changes are commited a backup file 'notebook.nb[version].bak' is created.
System menu entries in insert are created.

--------------------------------------
Usage: Evaluate the following commands
--------------------------------------

Commit - Making a commit

CommitInfo - Show a list of all Versions

CommitClean - Remove all commited files

Undo - Undo to the previous commit

Redo - Undo to the next commit

GotoCommit[n] - Go to the nth version

AutoCommit - Turn on automatic commits. Every time a cell is evaluated a new commit is made.

ManualCommit - Only do manual commits. Possible issue: The present notebook might not be a commited version, so no redo is possible.

------------------
Keyboard Shortcuts
------------------

Alt+z : Undo 
Alt+x : Redo 
Alt+s : Commit
Alt+d : Print CommitInfo at the end of the notebook

------------------------------
TODO's
------------------------------

(done) Check if the package was loaded already, to prevent multiple loads, to prevent creatation of multiple menu entries 

* Skip the "Are you sure you want to revert message.	   

* If the notebook was not saved yet ask for filename to save it on the first commit.

* Bug in GotCommit (update recentversion)

------------
IMPROVEMENTS
------------

* Imporve Commits: If the notebook was not changed, do not make a new commit.

* Use Dumpsave and Get to backup and restore (at least partly) the memory state.

* Make autocommits after text was entered - not only on evaluations
